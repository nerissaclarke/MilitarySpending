SIPRI Military Expenditure Data 1988-2015 (Source: April 2016 SIPRI)

Objective: To create a data visualization that illuminates how much the United States spends on the military compared to other countries around the world

Project #1: World Heat Map
Different shades of color for $ spent as a percent of GDP

Elements needed:
1. World map (geo json) that reads 2 letter country codes
2. Data bind
3. Color scale
4. Hover for information on each country
5. Default for countries/years with no data

Additional possible elements:
6. Slider for each year 1988-2015/data function that changes display based on slider
7. Ability to filter drill down by region
8. Ability to click a region or multiple countries and see a bar chart of those countries

Project #2:
Same idea, but using circle size to see relative size of spend

% of GDP helps to normalize the data, allows you to compare across countries of hugely different sizes
